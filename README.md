# Augmented-Robotic
The course objective is to develop a series of end-effectors for the Agilus KUKA robots that can be controlled in real-time by users during the fabrication process. 
Furthermore, monitor this fabrication process with a virtual reality headset and design a feedback system as an augmented reality application. The augmented reality application 
serves as a responsive platform that indicates the status, parameters, and guidelines of the fabrication process and that supports human/cyber-physical interaction as a virtual 
stencil.
